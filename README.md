# CHERI exercise

This is a small exercise to get started with CHERI (on RISC-V, QEMU emulation). 

## Recommended setup

While QEMU with CHERI-RISC-V should run on most Linux/Unix/Mac platforms, we recommend using Ubuntu 18.04 - if needed you can do this using a VM (for example from https://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu/#ubuntu-1804-vbox). Note that the tools take a while to build (several hours depending on CPU etc), so plan in some time to wait for the compilation to finish.

## Resources

The following resources by the CHERI team from Cambridge are useful:

 * The getting started guide, including installation instructions for the emulator etc: https://ctsrd-cheri.github.io/cheri-exercises/cover/index.html 
 * The `cheribuild` tool: https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribuild.git
 * How to copy files in/out of QEMU to the host is documented here: https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheri-exercises/pull/26
   Essentially, you can simply use `mount_smbfs -I 10.0.2.4 -N //10.0.2.4/source_root /mnt` in the QEMU guest, which will mount the CHERI base directory of the host on `/mnt`.

Also, if you ever need to exit QEMU: press `Ctrl-a` then release and press `x`   

## Task

We will use a (slightly modified) exercise from https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheri-exercises/

 * Fork this repository here (*not* the CHERI exercise one) - we expect you to add your solutions in this README.md where it says *INSERT SOLUTION HERE*. Please make sure you do reasonable commits and commit messages. You can also use other features of Github e.g. issues.
 
 * Assuming that you have installed CHERI-RISC-V in `~/cheri`, make sure your forked repo is cloned to `~/cheri/riscv-exercise`
 
 * Compile `buffer-overflow.c` to a RISC-V binary `buffer-overflow-hybrid` in hybrid capability mode (`riscv64-hybrid`). You can use the `ccc` script from `task/tools` (see the exercise docs for details) for that. What is the full commandline for compilation? 
 
--- 

We can invoke the the `ccc` script with the below command:  
 ```bash
 sh ~/cheri/riscv-exercise/task/tools/ccc riscv64-hybrid ~/cheri/riscv-exercise/task/buffer-overflow.c -o buffer-overflow-hybrid
 ```

The full commandline for actual compilation is: 
```bash
/home/osboxes/cheri/output/sdk/bin/clang -target riscv64-unknown-freebsd -march=rv64gcxcheri -mabi=lp64d -mno-relax --sysroot=/home/osboxes/cheri/output/sdk/sysroot-riscv64-hybrid/ -g -O2 -fuse-ld=lld -Wall -Wcheri buffer-overflow.c -o buffer-overflow-hybrid
```

If we take the recommended route of using aliases:

```bash
SYSROOT=~/cheri/output/sdk/sysroot-riscv64-hybrid/; export SYSROOT
CLANG=~/cheri/output/sdk/bin/clang; export CLANG
```

We could manually compile the code without using `ccc` as so: 

```bash
$CLANG -g -O2 -target riscv64-unknown-freebsd --sysroot="$SYSROOT" -fuse-ld=lld -mno-relax -march=rv64gcxcheri -mabi=l64pc128d -Wall -Wcheri buffer-overflow.c -o buffer-overflow-hybrid
```

*N.b. what is the importance between the ccc scipt using `-mabi=lp64d` vs the recommended CheriABI flag of `-mabi=l64pc128d` ?  
It seems the `lp64d` is specifically for conventional RISC-V, I assume this to allow for hybrid capability rather than purecap.*

---

* There is a security flaw in `buffer-overflow.c`. Briefly explain what the flaw is: 

As the filename aptly suggests, the flaw is a buffer overflow contained within the code where the `strcpy` function fails to bounds-check the the input argument prior to copying it into the buffer held for `Arg`.  
Due to the structure of the code whereby the buffer is initialised prior to the char `c` variable, the compiled code would place the initialised `c` next to the buffer in memory. Subsequently, any overflowing bytes would overwrite `c`.  
Specifically, the buffer holds 16 bytes which allows for 15 characters and the string's null termination found on line 65, however, as the `strcpy` is on the line preceeding this string termination, C language will allow it to fill the subsequent memory.  
In 64-bit architecture, memory is addressed in 8-byte increments and with the buffer being 16-bytes, and allowing for an 8-byte increment, this means the `c` variable will be 24-bytes from the start of the buffer, therefore by inputting a 24-byte string as an argument this will overwrite the `c` variable. 


* Start CHERI-RISC-V in QEMU, copy `buffer-overflow-hybrid` to the QEMU guest, and run it with a commandline argument that triggers the mentioned security flaw to overwrite the variable `c` with an attacker-controlled value. Give all the commands you have to run (assuming CHERI is in `~/cheri` and cheribuild in `~/cheribuild`):

```bash
python3 cheribuild.py run-riscv-hybrid #enter the cheribsd-hybrid system
mount_smbfs -I 10.0.2.4 -N //10.0.2.4/source_root /mnt #mount the shared /cheri folder from the host to /mnt
/mnt/riscv-exercise/task/buffer-overflow-hybrid 012345678901234567890123 # 24-character input
c = c #prior to the strcpy function
Arg = 012345678901234 #cut to 15-bytes to allow the null-termination on the 16th
c = 3 #the 24th byte '3' has overwritten c
```

---

* Now, compile the same program in pure capability mode (`riscv64-purecap`) to `buffer-overflow-purecap`. What happens when you run this program in QEMU with the same input that triggered the flaw in `buffer-overflow-hybrid`? Explain why this happens!

Firstly, to assert that the program works under generally expected input:

```bash
python3 cheribuild.py run-riscv-purecap #enter the cheribsd-hybrid system
mount_smbfs -I 10.0.2.4 -N //10.0.2.4/source_root /mnt #mount the shared /cheri folder from the host to /mnt
/mnt/riscv-exercise/task/buffer-overflow-purecap 012345678901234 # 15-character input
c = c #prior to the strcpy function
Arg = 012345678901234 # 15-bytes to allow the null-termination on the 16th
c = c #the 24th byte '3' has overwritten c
```

Secondly, to assess whether the purecap version works with a greater than 15-byte input (fifteen characters plus the obliged null byte):

```bash
/mnt/riscv-exercise/task/buffer-overflow-purecap 0123456789012345
c = c
In-address space security exception
root@cheribsd-riscv64-purecap:/mnt/riscv-exercise/task # Jun 28 12:10:54 cheribsd-riscv64-purecap kernel: pid 751 (buffer-overflow-pur), uid (0): Failed to open coredump file 'buffer-overflow-pur.core', error=13
```

And for posterity, a 24-byte input:

```bash
/mnt/riscv-exercise/task/buffer-overflow-purecap 012345678901234567890123
c = c
In-address space security exception
root@cheribsd-riscv64-purecap:/mnt/riscv-exercise/task # Jun 28 12:17:32 cheribsd-riscv64-purecap kernel: pid 753 (buffer-overflow-pur), uid (0): Failed to open coredump file 'buffer-overflow-pur.core', error=13
```

Using the diagnostic message tool `dmesg` provides us with the following messages:

`pid 751 (buffer-overflow-pur), jid 0, uid 0: exited on signal 34
pid 753 (buffer-overflow-pur), jid 0, uid 0: exited on signal 34`

From the host, we are able to determine that to which this signal refers with the following command: 

```bash
cat /home/osboxes/cheri/output/sdk/sysroot-riscv64/usr/include/sys/signal.h | grep 34
#define SIGPROT   34  /* in-address space security exception. */
```

It is clear that within the Cheri pure-capability environment it is dumping the program's execution upon the exception raised when hitting the strcpy function *when* it contains an input argument greater than 15-characters in length. 
This is a product that being within this environment causes all pointers to be wrapped within the Cheri capability architecture which includes a bound-checking function to allow for spacial protection.
